      # Why use React?

      - Do you want a fast rich client? Or as some might say, ambitious?

      - It's not a framework, use Ember (or your favorite Javascript framework)

      - React is just the view layer, but Rails already gives me a view layer!

      # I don't have an ambitious app..but I do have

      # How do I React in Rails?

      Do it by hand if you're sadistic:
      - Webpack. The goal is to generate a "bundle" that Rail's application.js uses or in your layouts directly

      Basic use cases where you want some JSX components asset compiled and sprinkled in:
      - gem 'react-rails'
      - global name space pollution

      Drink the JavaScript kool-aid that's already pre mixed:
      - gem 'react_on_rails'
      - JavaScript stays a 1st class citizen vs Gemified JS/Removes Globals on window
      - Hot reloading
      - Any other tools in the Node ecosystem

      But you're mixing HTML with JS, violation SoC

      ```js
      export default class Tweet extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return (
            <li className="collection-item avatar">
              <img src={this.props.gravatar} className="circle" />
              <span className="title">{this.props.name}</span>
              <time>{this.props.formattedDate}</time>
              <p>{this.props.body}</p>
            </li>
          )
        }
      }
      ```
      <blockquote>
        "UI presentation and UI interaction are closely intertwined. Ever work on a project with index.html and then one big app.js of jQuery select/trigger soup? That's not separation of concerns. That's just indirection."
